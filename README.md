# [osTicket](https://osticket.com) Plugin: Ticket Status Auto-changer
Ticket Status Auto-changer is a plugin for osTicket that allows you to automatically change the status of a ticket when a client replies. It has been tested and works on osTicket versions 1.11 through 1.15. It may work on later versions but has not been tested.

## Installation
1. Download as a zip and extract into `/include/plugins/statusautochange`.
2. In the admin panel, go to **Manage > Plugins**.
3. Click **Add New Plugin**.
4. Click **Install** next to "Ticket Status Auto-changer."

## Configuration
This plugin has only two settings: the "TO" status which you'd like a ticket to become when a client 
replies and the "FROM" status. The previous status the ticket needs to be in before the ticket change to 
the new status. 
You can choose any status that is an "open" or "closed" state.

Once you've added a status, save your changes, then enable the plugin.
